a) Write a sequential program to perform matrix-matrix multiplication X = A × B, where A is an n × m matrix and B is an m × p matrix, their matrix product A × B is an n × p matrix. Choose n=m=p=6. Fill the matrices with increasing whole numbers (start with 1,2,3 ... etc.). Print the output on the screen.
b) Write a parallel program using openMP that does the same job and prints the number of used cores as well.
Example output (e.g., assuming you have 8 cores on your machine available):
